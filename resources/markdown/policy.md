<h1 class="text-white uppercase">Privacy Policy</h1>

We appreciate your interest in the HopeXito Marketplace, available at <a href="https://hopexito.com" class="text-indigo-400">www.hopexito.com</a>. We respect your privacy. Therefore, we collect and process your personal data only in accordance with the relevant legal requirements. In no case do we rent or sell your personal data for marketing or other purposes.

This Privacy Policy explains the types of personal data we collect when you use the Marketplace and how we process it.

<h3 class="text-white uppercase">2. What is personal data</h3>

Personal data is all information that can be individually assigned to you either directly or indirectly. This includes, for example, your name, address, telephone number, cell phone number, fax number and email address. Non-personal data, on the other hand, is information of a general nature that cannot be used to determine your identity. This is, for example, the number of users of the Marketplace.

<h3 class="text-white uppercase">3. The type of personal data we collect</h3>

You can generally visit the Marketplace without providing us with any information that directly identifies you. Please note, however, that you may not be able to use certain areas of the Marketplace or certain of the services we offer.

<h3 class="text-white uppercase">3.1. Web Server Logs (Incl.IP Addresses)</h3>

When you visit and use the Marketplace, our web server automatically collects so-called access data out of technical necessity, which your terminal device automatically transmits. This log record may include the following information: your IP address, the date and time you are on the Marketplace, the pages you visit on the Marketplace, the name of the file you retrieve and the amount of data transferred, the message whether the retrieval was successful, the website you were on before (so-called referrer website), the browser you use (e.g. Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome), the operating system you use (e.g. Windows 10) as well as the domain name and address of your internet provider.

<h3 class="text-white uppercase">3.2. Personal</h3>

(a) Otherwise, we collect personal data from you if you have voluntarily provided it to us in order to provide, operate and administer the Marketplace in accordance with our User Agreement (see <a href="https://hopexito.com/terms-of-service" class="text-indigo-400">www.hopexito.com/terms-of-service</a>) and to provide you with our services.

Specifically, we collect (a) your username and email address when you create a user account and register for the Marketplace; (b) your name, shipping address, phone number, email address, and bank or payment information when you order a product through the Marketplace; (c) your name, address, phone number, email address and bank information when you sell products through the Marketplace; and (d) your email address when you fill out a form or send us an email. When we collect your personal data, we will inform you whether the provision of the respective personal data is required or merely optional, as well as about the possible consequences if you do not provide the respective information.

In addition, we collect personal data that you provide to us in connection with your visit to and use of the Marketplace and our services, e.g. your sales and order history as well as your movements and executed actions on the Marketplace.

<h3 class="text-white uppercase">5. Transfer of Personal Data</h3>

Your personal data is very important and helpful for us to provide and optimize the Marketplace and our services. We do not share your personal information with third parties unless (a) it is necessary for the provision of the Marketplace and/or our services; (b) otherwise permitted by applicable law; or (c) you have given us your consent. In light of the above, we will only share your personal data with third parties to the extent set out below.

5.1. In order to provide our services in the form of processing and coordinating sales or orders between users on the Marketplace, it is necessary to pass on your name, delivery address and telephone number to production, printing, logistics or processing service providers on behalf of the seller.

However, this information will not be made available to the aforementioned service providers for marketing purposes under any circumstances.

5.2. In the event that claims are made against Hopexito by third parties claiming that any content transmitted by you to the Marketplace violates applicable law, intellectual property rights of the third party (e.g. copyrights and ancillary copyrights, patents, trademarks, company logos, work titles or designs) and/or other rights of the third party (e.g. general personal rights or the right to one's own image), we are entitled in accordance with our User Agreement to pass on your name, address and/or further information about the content objected to by the third party to the third party in order to enable the third party to assert its rights against you.

5.3. We are further entitled to outsource the processing of personal data in whole or in part to external service providers who act for us as processors within the meaning of Article 4(8) GDPR. If these service providers are located outside the European Union or European Economic Area, we will take appropriate security measures in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements to ensure the security of your personal data.

For example, we use proprietary technology to specifically target users by creating advertising material based on the users' previous behavior.

<h3 class="text-white uppercase">6. How we secure your personal data</h3>

We take all necessary and reasonable steps to keep your personal data secure, but by its nature, unfortunately, no system is impenetrable. Due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that information is one hundred percent secure from unauthorized access during transmission over the Internet or while it is stored on our system or otherwise. Your payments are made over an encrypted connection or through a secure data processor. Access to your personal data on our databases is subject to appropriate technical security measures. Furthermore, only persons authorized by us can access your personal data to the extent necessary for their respective activities (so-called need-to-know principle).

<h3 class="text-white uppercase">7. Storage period</h3>

Your personal data will be stored by us only as long as it is necessary to achieve the purposes for which it was collected or – if there are any legal retention periods beyond this – for the duration of the legally prescribed retention period. Subsequently, your personal data will be deleted.

<h3 class="text-white uppercase">8. Cookies and similar technologies</h3>

For the processing of personal data using cookies and similar technologies in the context of the Marketplace, please see our Cookie Policy (including our Consent Manager Tool), which is part of this Privacy Policy.

You may have the right to request the deletion or restriction of the processing of your personal data if, for example, there is no longer a legitimate business purpose for such processing under this Privacy Policy or applicable law and legal retention obligations do not prevent further storage.
